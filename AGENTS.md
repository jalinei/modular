# AGENT Instructions

When modifying any code for this project:

1. Install dependencies with `npm install` if not already done.
2. Run the smoke tests using `npm test`. This executes `dashboard/test/run_browser_tests.sh` which runs the CasperJS tests.
3. Verify the Electron dashboard launches by running `npm start`.

Always ensure `npm test` completes successfully before committing changes that affect dashboard functionality.
